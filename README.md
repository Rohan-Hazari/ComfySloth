This is an E-Commerce website I made with React, React router 6 and [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)

### Features :

* Featured products on the Homepage and a functional newsletter form    
* The user can view products in Grid and List mode
* Sort the products according to their price and alphabetical order
* Apply various different filter according to their need
* View each product separately on Single page with more details
* Add products to cart (saved to local Storage)
* Login and Logout option
* Checkout the items in your cart (dummy card number provided)

Used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive) for authentication, [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart?lang=node&client=react) for payment , [Formspree](https://formspree.io) for the newsletter and useContext and useReducer Hook for state management

Used a [netlify function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) written in node.js to handle stripe API requests and response

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
